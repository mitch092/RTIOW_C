# Raytracing in One Weekend, in pure C11
This is an attempt at a simple raytracer written in simple, clean C code (or rather, hopefully as simple as C can get). 
No callbacks, no classes, no templates, no libraries, no frameworks,
no game engines, no physics simulations, no animations, no game loops.

Takes a description of a file (hardcoded in C, for now), a name for the image file, the width and height,
and generates the image file in one pass.
